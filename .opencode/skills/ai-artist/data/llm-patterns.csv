7,Chain of Thought,Technique,"Think through this step by step:\n1. First, consider [aspect 1]\n2. Then, analyze [aspect 2]\n3. Finally, conclude [outcome]\n\nShow your reasoning before the final answer.","Complex reasoning, math problems, logic puzzles, multi-factor decisions","Think through this step by step:\n1. First, identify the user's primary pain point\n2. Then, analyze which features address that pain\n3.

9,Self-Consistency,Technique,"Generate 3 independent solutions to this problem. Then compare them and provide the answer that appears most frequently or has strongest reasoning.","Math, factual questions, logic problems where verification matters","Generate 3 independent solutions to this pricing strategy problem. Then compare them and provide the answer that appears most frequently or has strongest reasoning.","Use with temperature >0; request explicit comparison; works best for verifiable answers"
10,ReAct Pattern,Technique,"Follow this pattern:\nThought: [current reasoning]\nAction: [tool or step to take]\nObservation: [result of action]\n...repeat...\nFinal Answer: [conclusion]","Agent-like tasks, research, when tools/steps need to be dynamic","Thought: I need to understand the competitor landscape first\nAction: Research top 3 competitors' pricing pages\nObservation: Found competitor A uses freemium, B uses trials...\nThought: Now I should compare to our current model\n...","Define available actions; show observation format; iterate until conclusion"
11,Self-Refine,Technique,"Step 1: Generate initial response\nStep 2: Critique your response - what's wrong or could be better?\nStep 3: Refine based on critique\nStep 4: Repeat until satisfactory or limit reached","Creative content, writing tasks, iterative improvement needed","Generate a headline for our product launch.\n\nThen critique it:\n- Is it specific enough?\n- Does it convey value?\n- Is it memorable?\n\nRefine based on your critique.","Specify critique criteria; set iteration limit; can request 2-3 rounds explicitly"

13,Persona Constraint,Control,"You only respond as [persona]. You never break character. Your responses always reflect [traits]. If asked something outside your expertise, respond as [persona] would.","Chatbots, roleplay, character-consistent interactions","You only respond as a helpful customer support agent for TechCorp.
